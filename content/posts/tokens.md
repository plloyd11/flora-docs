Design tokens are the building blocks of a product's visual design system. They are design-specific values that represent the core elements of a product's visual language, such as colors, typography, spacing, and other visual design elements. These tokens are used in design and development to ensure that a product's visual design is consistent and can be easily implemented and maintained. By using design tokens in your documentation, you can create a unified visual language that is consistent across different platforms and products. This helps to improve the overall user experience and makes it easier for designers and developers to work together and create cohesive designs.
