## Primary font

MongoDB Value Serif has been specially customized for MongoDB. Our bespoke font should be used for all primary headlines and is reserved exclusively for these cases. It works best when scaled up and at medium weight. Our serif should be used in title case and never styled in all capital letters.

### Secondary font

Euclid is a modern Sans Serif that pairs effortlessly with MongoDB Value Serif. Other than our Primary and Secondary headlines, all body copy should be set in Euclid. More weights are included for various needs in both digital and print, but as a general rule, if it’s not a headline, it should be set in Euclid. This includes UI elements like buttons and secondary headlines.

### Tertiary font

Source Code Pro should be used for specific pieces of information like eyebrows, code and small UI elements. It should never be used as a headline, or for anything larger than 14px.
